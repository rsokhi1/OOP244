   I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

In this workshop I learned how to define and create binary member operator, type conversion operator, unary member operator, helper binary operator between classes and helper operator between a primitive type and a class.

I can now create any binary member operator I need for a class and I also overloaded the operators that I created in this workshop using the overloading technique that I learned before. The thing that I enjoyed and liked the best was type conversion operator. I never knew that I can totally change the type of the value and get the value I needed just with a few simple steps. I am sure that I will be using the type conversion operator a lot in the future.
